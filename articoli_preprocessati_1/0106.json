The new site is designed to encourage creativity \r\n      and to provide a space where perfumers and customers can freely \r\n      collaborate outside of their usual environments with time to reflect, \r\n      research, and explore.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      Nicolas Mirzayantz, Divisional CEO, Scent, for IFF said, \u201cL\u2019Atelier du \r\n      Parfumeur \u2013 IFF presents a unique experience in the industry for \r\n      visionaries and creatives that are interested in exploring and \r\n      understanding our driving purpose of artistically designing fragrance. \r\n      Every detail of the space was thoughtfully considered for its power to \r\n      inspire and its connection with technical intelligence, craftsmanship, \r\n      nature, heritage, and modernity.\u201d\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      Located near the Company\u2019s IFF-LMR Naturals site, its proximity will \r\n      offer the \u201cresidents\u201d of the Atelier with unfettered access to unique \r\n      natural ingredients in the course of their explorations and \r\n      experimentation. The site will also serve as a home to \r\n      artists-in-residence \u2013 both from within and outside of perfumery \u2013 to \r\n      ensure a constant flow of creative thinking. The atelier will \r\n      periodically open its doors during special events to share and ignite \r\n      the passion of perfumery with the public. While designed to nurture the \r\n      artistic process, the site is also intended to be flexible and support \r\n      the evolving needs of IFF and the industry.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      \u201cThis is an exciting moment for IFF, and one that I am very proud of,\u201d \r\n      continued Mr. Mirzayantz. \u201cIt is an opportunity to bring fresh focus on \r\n      the art and expertise that is at the very heart of perfumery. We are \r\n      looking forward to this space becoming a pulse point of endless \r\n      imagination and innovation.\u201d\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      L\u2019Atelier du Parfumeur \u2013 IFF will open its doors on May 27, 2019.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      # # #\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      \r\nMeet IFF\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n      International Flavors & Fragrances Inc.
