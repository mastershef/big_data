(PMI) (NYSE: PM), today addressed the Boston College \r\n      Chief Executives Club, setting out how PMI is radically changing its \r\n      business to unsmoke the world and encourage the hundreds of millions of \r\n      current adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking cigarettes to \r\n      change to better options. The speech was delivered days after the U.S. \r\n      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that IQOS, PMI\u2019s \r\n      electrically heated tobacco system, is appropriate for the protection of \r\n      public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      \u201cWe need to cut through the fog of misinformation; not all tobacco \r\n      companies are the same. No other company in our industry has stated such \r\n      bold claims: To wholly change their business model and unsmoke the \r\n      world,\u201d said Calantzopoulos at the event. Further, he called on \r\n      attendees to consider the possibilities of working in greater \r\n      collaboration with governments, NGOs and others, adding: \u201cSmokers will \r\n      quit cigarettes in favor of better options much more quickly if \r\n      regulatory bodies and healthcare stakeholders support a pragmatic and \r\n      realistic harm reduction vision. At the very least, we should make sure \r\n      existing smokers have access to, and accurate information about, better \r\n      alternatives to cigarettes.\u201d\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      Just as Boston\u2019s private and state sectors prioritized their investment \r\n      behind positive social change to build a culture rich in academics, \r\n      health and wellness, and innovation, PMI is investing significantly in \r\n      scientific research, development and manufacturing facilities\u2014to the \r\n      value of over $6 billion USD to date\u2014to transform the public health \r\n      landscape of tomorrow.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      Calling the FDA\u2019s decision a \u201cmajor milestone,\u201d Calantzopoulos explained \r\n      that PMI is determined to continue its transformative vision to \r\n      positively change public health and unsmoke the world.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      A complete copy of these remarks is available here.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      Further information about the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \r\n      announcement is available here.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      \r\nPhilip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n      Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the \r\n      tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace \r\n      cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would \r\n      otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. \r\n      PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the \r\n      manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated \r\n      electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing \r\n      products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new \r\n      category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much \r\n      better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary \r\n      capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and \r\n      scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free \r\n      products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory \r\n      requirements. PMI's smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes \r\n      heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of March\u00a031, \r\n      2019, PMI estimates that approximately 7.3 million adult smokers around \r\n      the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI\u2019s \r\n      heat-not-burn product, which is currently available for sale in 47 \r\n      markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.
