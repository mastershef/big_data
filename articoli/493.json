KCI markets a broad range of negative pressure wound \r\n      therapy, specialty surgical and advanced wound dressing products in \r\n      approximately 90 countries.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      Since 2011, Apax Partners, CPPIB and PSP Investments worked closely with \r\n      Acelity/KCI\u2019s senior leadership team to transform the business into a \r\n      leading global company focused on advanced wound care and specialty \r\n      surgical solutions. The company\u2019s strategic M&A program included \r\n      targeted acquisitions, such as Systagenix, in 2013, and Crawford \r\n      Healthcare, in 2018, and disposals of non-core businesses, such as the \r\n      LifeCell business unit, which was sold for $2.9 billion in 2017, and the \r\n      Therapeutic Support Systems (TSS) unit, which was sold in 2012. The \r\n      company also has undertaken a range of organic growth initiatives \r\n      including investments in R&D, clinical studies, and the expansion of its \r\n      sales force.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      The product offering includes the KCI-branded negative pressure wound \r\n      therapy, advanced wound dressings, and negative pressure surgical \r\n      incision management systems. The company\u2019s industry-leading brands \r\n      include V.A.C.\u00ae Therapy, PREVENA\u2122 Therapy and PROMOGRAN PRISMA\u2122 Matrix, \r\n      as well as the iOn Digital Health platforms. Upon completion of the \r\n      transaction, KCI will become an integral part of 3M\u2019s Medical Solutions \r\n      business, which applies 3M science to deliver safe and effective \r\n      solutions that improve clinical outcomes and healthcare economics.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      \u201cToday, KCI embarks upon a new era in its long history as a pioneer in \r\n      healthcare,\u201d said R. Andrew Eckert, CEO of Acelity. \u201cThe combination of \r\n      KCI with 3M will accelerate the reach of a business that is a leader in \r\n      innovation, customer experience and clinical and economic evidence. \r\n      Backed by the resources and expertise of 3M, KCI will be \r\n      able to offer clinicians and patients even more compelling solutions \r\n      designed to speed healing and improve outcomes. I would like to thank \r\n      Apax, CPPIB and PSP Investments for their close partnership and \r\n      strategic direction over the years shaping KCI into a premier global \r\n      advanced wound care company.\u201d\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n      Steven Dyson, Chairman of the Board of Acelity and Partner at Apax \r\n      Partners, said, \u201cWe are proud of our close work with management to \r\n      successfully transform KCI through a range of growth initiatives, \r\n      including an M&A program, that enhanced the Company\u2019s strategic \r\n      direction.
